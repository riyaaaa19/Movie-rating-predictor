## Installation

To use this project, you will need Python and some dependencies. You can set it up by following these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie_predictor.git
    cd movie_predictor
    ```

2. Install required libraries using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file yet, you can create one by running:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Make sure to install libraries like `pandas`, `sklearn`, `numpy`, etc.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of movies with features like movie name, genre, language, and other relevant data. It also contains ratings that will be predicted by the machine learning model.

Make sure your dataset has the following columns:
- `Movie Name`
- `Genre`
- `Language`
- `Rating` (target variable)

---

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Dataset**: Place your dataset CSV file (e.g., `movie_data.csv`) in the project folder.

2. **Run the Model**: 
    To start training the model, you can simply run:
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

3. **Prediction**: After the model is trained, you can use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

## Model Training

In this project, we use a **Random Forest Regressor** model to predict movie ratings.

- **Data Preprocessing**: We handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and split the data into training and test sets.
- **Training**: The model is trained using the training data (`80%` of the total data) and then evaluated on the test data (`20%` of the total data).
  
The code uses a pipeline with the following steps:
1. Data Preprocessing (handling missing values and encoding categorical features)
2. Model training (Random Forest Regressor)

---

## Evaluation

The model performance is evaluated using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** to measure the accuracy of the predictions.

```bash
Mean Squared Error: 0.42
```
